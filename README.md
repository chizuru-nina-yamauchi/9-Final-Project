# My project from July 2023.

## First OF ALL
This is an older project I have done before learning how to use git.
I have learned HTML and CSS and created this project.
Therefore, I uploaded this project with one Git commit on GitHub in September 2023 after I learned how to use Git.

## If you are curious about improved version of my web page

Please visit another project [here](https://github.com/chizuru-nina-yamauchi/About-Me-HTML).
This is the project I kept working further after I learned about Git. 
This will bring you to my another GitHub page.
